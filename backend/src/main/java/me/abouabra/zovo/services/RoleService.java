/**
 * <p>The <code>RoleService</code> class provides core service-level operations for managing roles within the application.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class acts as a bridge between the persistence layer and business logic by using the provided {@link RoleRepository}
 * and {@link RoleMapper}. It contains methods to handle role-related operations, such as retrieving, mapping, and
 * managing roles in the system.</p>
 *
 * <p>Key responsibilities of <code>RoleService</code> include:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Interacting with {@link RoleRepository} to perform CRUD operations on role entities.</li>
 *   <li>Leveraging {@link RoleMapper} to convert between {@code Role} entities and {@code RoleDTO} representations,
 *       ensuring seamless data transformation across application layers.</li>
 *   <li>Providing high-level business logic for role management that supports authentication, authorization,
 *       and user role assignments.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This class is annotated with:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><code>@Service</code>: Indicates that it is a Spring-managed service component, enabling dependency injection
 *       for its consumers.</li>
 *   <li><code>@AllArgsConstructor</code>: Generates a constructor with required dependencies
 *       (e.g., {@code RoleRepository} and {@code RoleMapper}).</li>
 *   <li><code>@Data</code>: Automatically provides getter, setter, toString, equals, and hashCode implementations
 *       as part of Lombok's functionality.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The <code>RoleService</code> class is typically used in security implementations to manage user roles and permissions
 * and is integral to authorization processes in the application.</p>
